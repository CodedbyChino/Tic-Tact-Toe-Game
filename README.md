# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
This project implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game using Python. It allows players to play against each other or against the computer in single-player mode. The game follows standard Tic Tac Toe rules where players take turns marking positions on a 3x3 grid, aiming to form a line of three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Usage
Tic Tac Toe is a classic game that is both fun and challenging. This project provides a convenient way to play the game either against friends or against a computer opponent. It can be used for entertainment or to improve strategic thinking skills.

### Instructions
1. Choose the game mode (single player or multiplayer).
2. If playing in single player mode, decide who plays as "X" and who plays as "O".
3. Players take turns marking positions on the grid by entering numbers from 1 to 9.
4. The game ends when one player forms a line of three marks or when the board is full without a winner.
